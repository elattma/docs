1. Navigate to your [Library](https://mimo.team/dashboard/library) on our website.
2. Press the **Add Connection** button to begin configuring a new connection for your library.
3. Select the data source to build your connection around.
4. Choose your preferred authentication method (OAuth, API credentials, etc.) and authenticate.
5. Wait until Mimo ingests your data and makes it available for the [Context](/api-reference/endpoints/context) API.
6. Give your connection a descriptive name and press the **Add Connection** button.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 to add as many connections as you'd like.

<Note>
  The data ingestion process may take a while depending on the amount of data you are connecting. The connection cards in your library will display the status of the ingestion for each connection.
