## Using the Test Library

The [Retrieve Context](/api-reference/endpoints/context/get) method accesses the Test Library by default if no value is supplied for `library_id`.

## Library Contents

The test library includes information from four integrations: Gmail, Google Docs, Zoho CRM, and Zendesk Customer Support. This library mimics data from an enterprise and is specifically centered around the enterprise's customers.
