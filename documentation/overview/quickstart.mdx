## Obtaining an API Key
1. If you haven't already, [create a Mimo account](https://mimo.team)
2. Navigate to the [API settings](https://mimo.team/dashboard/settings/api)
3. Copy your API key
## Selecting a Dataset
If you're new to the Mimo API, we suggest using the [test dataset](documentation/data/test-dataset). This will allow you to start using the API right away, without the need to upload your own data. The test dataset is enabled by default.

<Info>
  Support for uploading your own data to the developer environment is coming very soon.
