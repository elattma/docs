## Obtaining an API Key
1. If you haven't already, [create a Mimo account](https://mimo.team)
2. Navigate to the [API settings](https://mimo.team/dashboard/settings/api)
3. Copy your API key

## Selecting a Library
If you're new to the Mimo API, we suggest using our [test library](documentation/data/test-library). This will allow you to start using the API right away, without the need to upload your own data.

Also, you can use Mimo to [build a library](/documentation/data/build-a-library).
