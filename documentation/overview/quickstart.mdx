## Obtaining an API Key
1. If you haven't already, [create a Mimo account](https://mimo.team).
2. Configure an app with Mimo and obtain an API key by following [these instructions](/api-reference/overview/authentication).

## Selecting a Library
If you're new to the Mimo API, we suggest using our [Test Library](documentation/data/test-library). This will allow you to start using the API right away, without the need to upload your own data.

If you would like to use your own data, see [Building a Library](/documentation/data/building-a-library).
