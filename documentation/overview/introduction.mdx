description: "Welcome to the Mimo API"
---
Mimo is a unified data platform that goes beyond traditional vector database implementations, enabling seamless connections between AI agents and enterprise data sources. 

Mimo's objective is to abstract away the need for developers to maintain integrations and data stores for each of their end users. Add the Mimo API as a tool accessible to your AI agents to give them a singular natural language querying interface for enterprise context retrieval.

The future of enterprise software solutions is "Bring Your Own Library."

## Order of Operations

1. An end user must either create a Mimo library or bring an existing one. 
2. An end user can either create their library through an embedded experience on your site or on Mimo's website.
3. An end user authorizes through an embedded experience, passing the library ID to the AI agent.
4. With the library ID and your agent's API key, your agent can now query the end user's data by calling the Mimo API.
