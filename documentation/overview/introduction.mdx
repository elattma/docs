Mimo is a fully managed context retrieval platform for your AI agents and LLM apps that extends beyond the current implementations of vector databases.  

Using Mimo abstracts away the need to maintain integrations and data stores for each of your end users. Additionally, equipping your agents with the Mimo API gives them a singular natural language querying interface for retrieving context from your end user's knowlege base. This capability will vastly deepen your agents' understanding of your end user and reimagine the levels of complexity in tasks they can accomplish.
