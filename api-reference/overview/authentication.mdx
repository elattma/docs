## Obtaining an API Key

To obtain an API Key navigate to your [API settings](https://mimo.team/dashboard/settings/api) on our website. Here, you can view your active API key or generate a new one. We currently support only one active API key per account.

## Making an Authenticated Request

Whenever you make a request to the Mimo API, you must include the header `x-api-key` with your API key as its value.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl ...
     --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>'
     ...
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {'x-api-key': <YOUR_API_KEY>}
response = requests.get(..., headers=headers, ...)
```

</CodeGroup>
