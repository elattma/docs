## Obtaining an API Key

To obtain an API Key, you need to visit the [API settings](https://mimo.team/dashboard/settings/api) on our website. Once there, you can either view your currently active API key or generate a new one. Please note that each account can only have one active API key at a time.

## Authenticating Your Requests

When making a request to the Mimo API, you must include the `x-api-key` header with your API key as its value.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl ...
     --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>'
     ...
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {'x-api-key': <YOUR_API_KEY>}
response = requests.get(..., headers=headers, ...)
```

</CodeGroup>
