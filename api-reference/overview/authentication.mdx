## Creating an App

Before accessing the Mimo API, you'll need to create an app on our website. This is a quick and easy process that can be completed in just a few simple steps:

1. Visit the [developer settings](https://mimo.team/dashboard/settings/api) and click the **Enable Access** button to enable developer access.
2. Click the **Create App** button.
3. Give your application a descriptive name and press the **Create** button.

## Obtaining an API Key

Mimo uses API keys to manage API authentication. API keys are provisioned at the app level, meaning each app will have its own API key. An app's API key can be found under the [developer settings](https://mimo.team/dashboard/settings/api) after selecting a specific app.

## Authenticating Your Requests

When making a request to the Mimo API, you must include the `x-api-key` header with an API key as its value.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl ...
     --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>'
     ...
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {'x-api-key': <YOUR_API_KEY>}
response = requests.get(..., headers=headers, ...)
```

</CodeGroup>
