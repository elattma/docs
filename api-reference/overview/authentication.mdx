## Creating an App

Before accessing the Mimo API, you'll need to create an app on our website. This is a quick and easy process that can be completed in just a few simple steps:

1. Visit the [developer settings](https://mimo.team/dashboard/settings/api) and click the **Enable Access** button to enable developer access.
2. Click the **Create App** button.
3. Give your application a descriptive name and press the **Create** button.

## Basic Auth

Mimo uses basic auth to manage API authentication. Basic auth is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. It allows credentials to be sent in the HTTP header. The Mimo API uses basic auth to authenticate requests.

Firstly, you'll need your secret key. Each developer has a secret key that can be found under the [developer settings](https://mimo.team/dashboard/settings/api) after being granted developer access.

Secondly, you'll need an API key. API keys are provisioned at the app level, meaning each app will have its own API keys. An app's API key can be found under the [developer settings](https://mimo.team/dashboard/settings/api) after selecting a specific app.

To authenticate a request with Basic Auth, simply include your API key as the username and your secret key as the password in your request's `Authorization` header.

Here's an example:
<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl ...
     --header 'Authorization: b64_encoded(API_KEY:SECRET_KEY)'
     ...
```

```python Python
import requests
from base64 import b64encode

token = b64encode(f"{API_KEY}:{SECRET_KEY}".encode('utf-8')).decode("ascii")

headers = {'Authorization': f'Basic {token}'}
response = requests.get(..., headers=headers, ...)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Bearer Auth

This is on our roadmap. If you'd like us to prioritize this, please let us know by emailing us at [admin@mimo.team](mailto:admin@mimo.team)
