Equip your AI agents with the Mimo API to give them the ability to retrieve the most relevant and meaningful context from a Mimo Library.

The Mimo API is designed to be flexible and easy-to-use to enable the best developer experience possible. In this documentation, you will find all the information needed to navigate our API, including instructions for authentication, detailed descriptions of our endpoints, and best practices for giving your agents the ability to use the API to retrieve context autonomously.

We look forward to working with you to help you build powerful applications at the bleeding edge of agentic software.
