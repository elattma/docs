title: "Pagination"
---
While working with the Mimo API, certain API methods will limit the number of tokens that are returned in certain properties of a response. For example, the [Retrieve Context](/api-reference/endpoints/context/retrieve-context) method enforces a token limit with the `max_tokens` parameter, which defaults to 2000. Certain methods implement pagination to allow users to get the next page of results for a given query. Read on to understand how the Mimo API uses pagination and the appropriate patterns to follow.

<Note>To understand more about tokens and how to count them, see [this tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) from OpenAI. Note, other models may use different methods to tokenize strings.</Note>

## Cursor-based Pagination
The Mimo API uses a cursor-based approach for handling pagination. Cursors are like pointers that reference a specific position where your last request left off, allowing you to avoid loading the entire set to retrieve just a slice of the data.

When you use a cursor-paginated method, you will receive a portion of the total set of results and a cursor that points to the next page of the results, if not all of them could be returned at once.
## `next_token`
When you receive a response from the Mimo API, the response may include a `next_token`. If a `next_token` is present, the API limited the response because the results exceeded `max_tokens`. To get the next page of results, simply include `next_token` as a parameter in a subsequent request.
## Example
Here's an example request to the [Retrieve Context](/api-reference/endpoints/context/retrieve-context) method that would return a paginated response.
```
GET https://api.mimo.team/context?query=last%2010%20emails&max_tokens=100
```
We get back a response that contains our `Context` list and a `next_token`, indicating that more results were found, but not returned.
```json
{
  "contexts": [
    {
      "text": ...,
      "score": 1.0,
      "source": {
        "integration": {
          "name": "google_mail",
          "category": "email"
        },
        "page": {
          "id": "1234567890",
          "link": "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1234567890",
          "type": "email"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "next_token": "b2Zmc2V0OjEwLGxpbWl0OjEwMA=="
}
```
Finally, to get the next page of results, we issue a request with the same query and include the `next_token` in the query parameters. Note that subsequent requests can request different response sizes by assigning a different value to `max_tokens`.
```
GET https://api.mimo.team/context?query=last%2010%emails&max_tokens=200&next_token=b2Zmc2V0OjEwLGxpbWl0OjEwMA==
```
