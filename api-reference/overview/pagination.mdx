title: "Pagination"
---
While working with the Mimo API, certain API methods will limit the number of tokens that are returned in certain properties of a response. For example, the [Retrieve Context](/api-reference/endpoints/context/retrieve-context) method enforces a token limit with the `max_tokens` parameter, which defaults to 2000. Certain methods implement pagination to allow users to get the next page of results for a given query. Read on to understand how the Mimo API uses pagination and the appropriate patterns to follow.

<Note>To understand more about tokens and how to count them, see [this tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) from OpenAI. Note, other models may use different methods to tokenize strings.</Note>

## Cursor-based Pagination
The Mimo API uses a cursor-based approach for handling pagination. Cursors are like pointers that reference a specific position where your last request left off, allowing you to avoid loading the entire set to retrieve just a slice of the data.

When you use a cursor-paginated method, you will receive a portion of the total set of results and a cursor that points to the next page of the results, if not all of them could be returned at once.
## `next_token`
When you make a request to the Mimo API and receive a response, the response may contain a `next_token`. This indicates that the API has limited the response because the number of results has exceeded the maximum allowed limit, known as `max_tokens`.

To retrieve the next page of results, you can include the `next_token` value as a parameter in your next request. This will enable you to obtain the additional results that were not included in the previous response.
## Example
Here's an example request to the [Retrieve Context](/api-reference/endpoints/context/retrieve-context) method that would return a paginated response.
```text Request
GET https://api.mimo.team/context?query=last%2010%20emails&max_tokens=100
```
We get back a response that contains our `Context` list and a `next_token`, indicating that more results were found, but not returned.
```json Response
{
  "contexts": [
    {
      "text": ...,
      "score": 1.0,
      "source": {
        "integration": {
          "name": "google_mail",
          "category": "email"
        },
        "page": {
          "id": "1234567890",
          "link": "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1234567890",
          "type": "email"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "next_token": "b2Zmc2V0OjEwLGxpbWl0OjEwMA=="
}
```
To retrieve additional results beyond the first page, simply execute the same request, but include the `next_token` parameter in your query parameters. You can modify the size of the response by changing the value of `max_tokens` in subsequent requests.
```text Request
GET https://api.mimo.team/context?query=last%2010%emails&max_tokens=200&next_token=b2Zmc2V0OjEwLGxpbWl0OjEwMA==
```
