## What Is a Query?
In the [Retrieve Context](/api-reference/endpoints/context/retrieve-context) method, a query is passed to describe the context that is desired. The query should be consice, yet complete and meaningful. It should be phrased as a description, rather than a question, to guarantee the best context. For instance, if you want to retrieve the last five emails from Troy Wilkerson, it's better to use the query `"last 5 emails from Troy Wilkerson"` rather than `"What are the last 5 emails from Troy Wilkerson"`.
## Best Practices
1. A query should be phrased as a description, not a question.
- For instance, if you want to retrieve the last five emails from Troy Wilkerson, it's better to use the query `"last 5 emails from Troy Wilkerson"` rather than `"What are the last 5 emails from Troy Wilkerson"`.
