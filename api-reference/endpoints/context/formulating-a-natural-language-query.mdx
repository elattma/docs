## What Is a Query?
In the [Retrieve Context](/api-reference/endpoints/context/retrieve-context) method, a query is passed to describe the context that is desired. A query is a concise description of the information that is desired from a Mimo Library. It can be as broad, e.g. `"information about our marketing department"`, or as specific, e.g. `"customer support tickets from the last 5 days that mention payment issues"`, as desired.
## Best Practices
1. A query should be phrased as a description, not a question.
- For instance, if you want to retrieve the last five emails from Troy Wilkerson, it's better to use the query `"last 5 emails from Troy Wilkerson"` rather than `"What are the last 5 emails from Troy Wilkerson"`.
